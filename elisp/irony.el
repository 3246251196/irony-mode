;;; Commentary:

;; This file provide `irony-mode' a minor mode for C, C++ (eventually
;; Objective C and Objective C++). This minor mode does nothing alone
;; in buffers where it's activated.
;;
;; TODO:
;; - explain `irony-mode' in details.
;; - checkdoc ?
;; - when an irony-mode buffer is exited, inform the irony process ?
;;   (change-major-mode-hook)
;; - ...
